# Feedback to The Carpentries
1. Live coding should universally be called live teaching demonistration as not all demos involve coding (e.g. spreadsheets, OpenRefine, etc.)

2. There a bit of confusion about teaching demo exercises - on day 1 afternnon and day 2 morning - a bit of repetition and perhaps time can be used better elsewhere? People were confused and started live coding on day 1 afernoon when they should have just taught a concept to their audience, perhaps from their concept map.

3. Current schedule is gruelling and 15 minutes breaks are not enough, and more material than can be covered.

4. Our example schedule with some lessons skipped and Q&A explicitly in the agenda.
