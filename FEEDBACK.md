# Feedback to The Carpentries
1. Live coding should universally be called live teaching demonistration as not all demos involve coding (e.g. spreadsheets, OpenRefine, etc.)

2. There a bit of confusion about teaching demo exercises - on day 1 afternnon and day 2 morning - a bit of repetition and perhaps time can be used better elsewhere? People were confused and started live coding on day 1 afernoon when they should have just taught a concept to their audience, perhaps from their concept map.

3. Current schedule is gruelling and 15 minutes breaks are not enough, and more material than can be covered.

4. Our example schedule with some lessons skipped (learners' profiles and Bloom's taxonomy) and Q&A explicitly in the agenda.

5. GDPR issues when signing up for teaching demos/community discussions and leaving email addresses around public Etherpads.

6. CoC email not correct or needs checking (confidential@carpentries.org vs coc@carpentries.org)?

7. Feedback for ourselves when doing online instructor training - when people are in the breakout rooms they loose the view of the exercise slide - just make sure that the text of the exercise is replicated in Google doc/Etherpad and if you modify it in any way make sure those modifications are reflected in the shared doc too (e.g. if you ask them not to write feedback in the doc for example and do feedback verbally).

# Feedback to us from learners

## What went well/what you liked/what tools/techniques are you excited about using?
- the part on cognitive science is really interesting and can be applied to any side of teaching not only carpentries-wise
- Useful to learn about different types of expertise and how to selectively apply different teaching methods
- I appreciated the examples of how to ask multiple choice questions to help diagnose learner’s issues
- I like that you are conscious of “zoom fatigue” and have built in extra breaks to combat that +1
- practical exercises were useful
- Concept maps are exceptionally handy
- Very useful information on memory usage and techniques to work with short term memory +1
-I enjoyed thinking about the mind maps
- Great to delve deep into cognitive sciences/ pedagogy foundations etc 
- I like the scaffolding approach in general and the faded example +2
- I wasn’t aware of how often I use dismissive language like ‘just’ - really good to know about that so I can improve when supporting colleagues, students, learners; +1+1
- I found the faded examples method useful.
- despite not being a face-to-face course, it went well and was mich more interactive than I expected and ran very smoothly +1
- I liked the explanation making explicit the need to avoid overload 
- I wasn’t looking forward to doing this over Zoom, but it’s working out better than I anticipated. I also like how the schedule has been modified to give us a bit more time out. (This is also useful practical experience for helping with our School’s shift to mostly online teaching in September!)

## What can be improved upon/what was confusing/what needs clarification?

- When everyone is using google drive it gets a little bit confusing and difficult to use
- I find google docs a bit clunky to use
- The link to the 2018 annual report was broken - I had to google it. I submitted a PR for this on GitHub!
- google docs is a bit tricky to use together I find there is a lot of lag
- Bit tricky to make concept models etc quickly on slides (for me anyway), but doing it on paper makes it quite difficult to share - maybe a little more time on some of these exercises, or encourage folks that pen/paper is still ok :)
- The mental model section was difficult to visualise without examples, difficult to picture the level of detail or concepts to include +2
- Providing an example diagram of a mental model before asking participants to create their own would be helpful +1
 Would it be possible to have more shorter breaks? The hour and a half is a long time to stare at a screen
+1 .  Its also a long time to talk - you did well! +1 +1
- In general, need to providing sufficient example/ abstraction before ask for tasks, also some missed concepts regarding learning mechanism - incorp. findings from other sci. fields beyond psychology, e.g. medicine etc.
- I miss the interaction in an actual class room. I guess nothing that can be changed at this stage. +1
- Unsure how to manage lessons where students have a wide range of expertise
- It would be good to know methods / tools for implementing assessment (just ask a class to throw up the hand on the correct answer? a polling tool suited to rapid answer and display? Ether pad and asterixis?)
- I miss the f2f aspect when doing exercises. It’s a bit lonely working on them in isolation. Having people to work with and bounce off makes them more enjoyable.
- I wasn’t a fan of the mind mapping exercises as I’ve never found these ideas very useful, and my brain is mainly mush at present! (Actually, I think my brain is broken!) (Also a concrete example would have helped to get into the first exercise.) +1000000
- Some more practical examples of some of the concepts would be helpful +1
- Assigning a co-host in zoom can help you mute/manage participants :)
